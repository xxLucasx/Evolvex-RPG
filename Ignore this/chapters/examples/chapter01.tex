\section{Social}
\label{sec:gameplay:Social}

This phase determines how they interact with other species in their territory:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Aggressive
	\item Cooperative
	\item Neutral 
	\item Defensive
	\item Hostile
	\item Special
\end{itemize}

Aggressive stance increases the amount of territory you control, but reduces the efficiency of your feeding +10\%Territory gain, -10\%food gain\newline
Cooperative decreases the amount of territory you control, but increases the efficiency of your feeding -15\% territory gain, 15\% food gain (my idea also add "`trade"' deals.\newline
Neutral, You gain no modifiers\newline
Defensive  -10\% territory gain + 2 defense\newline
Hostile Generally only available to carnivores, this allows you to outright attack other species.\newline

Players gain new territory with  Explorer skill + D10

They can move into new tiles = Movement skill/4 rounded up

Species can attack other species' territory, to gain territory as well.  Species require aggressive stance and a trait that lets them attack. (Work In progress)

\section{Feeding}
\label{sec:gameplay:Feeding}

Feeding has two phases one for herbivores and one for carnivores.
Omnivores can partcipate in both phases.

1. Phase

Herbivores/Omnivores will feed from a pool.
Add Formular from feeding here.

2. Phase

Carnivores/Omnivores will feed by attacking other animals
Add Formular from feeding here.

If a species has no population it becomes extinct 

(Add social event here)
(Add here maybe "`trading"')
