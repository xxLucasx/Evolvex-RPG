Starting Points:
\begin{itemize}

	\item Denovian Era 75 EVO points Devonian
	\item Missipian Era 100 EVO points Mississippian and Pennsylvanian: two clustered eras derived from the old Carboniferous period, both old and new considered valid, your preference
	\item +25 points for each later era
\end{itemize}

Add the Evo points from milestone \ref{sec:gameplay:Evolution} from your starting population to your starting Evo points.
