      abstract     = {In this thesis, an automatic face recognition system is
                      developed which is invariant against varying facial
                      expressions and poses. This is an essential condition for
                      the application as a non-intrusive person recognition
                      system.Existing face recognition systems require a frontal,
                      neutral view of faces (norm-face) to perform a robust
                      classification. To achieve a robust recognition using these
                      methods under varying head orientations and facial
                      expressions, a sophisticated pre-processing of general
                      facial images is introduced which is capable of transforming
                      a general facial image into a norm-face image using a
                      model-based normalization approach. For generating the
                      norm-face image the size and the position of the face is
                      determined using an efficient, holistic detection algorithm.
                      Afterwards, facial landmarks are localized using a
                      statistical face model that combines textural information as
                      well as the position of the facial landmarks extracted from
                      sample (facial) views. By applying an iterative fitting
                      algorithm, the values of the model parameters are determined
                      so that the model represents the original facial image in an
                      optimal way. The position of the facial landmarks in the
                      processed image can then be derived. The subsequent,
                      two-stage head model fitting process is based on the
                      definition of correspondences of multiple facial features
                      between the 2D image and the 3D model. By optimizing the
                      parameters of an affine transformation the model is
                      initially adapted to the head pose. The optimization process
                      minimizes the distances between the 2D facial landmarks and
                      the corresponding, projected 3D model vertices. In the
                      second step, a distortion of the head model using a locally
                      effective RBF interpolation is performed for a more precise
                      modeling of the individual facial proportions and the shown
                      facial expression. After the fitting process, the model is
                      textured, re-transformed into its original reference form
                      and the image information of a possibly occluded face half
                      is reconstructed. The final projection into a suitable image
                      plane results in a neutral frontal view. The performance of
                      this normalization approach was comprehensively evaluated.
                      From all detailed results two main conclusion can be
                      derived: A recognition performance of $89,4\%$ is achieved
                      when the pose deviation is up to a maximum of 45°
                      horizontally (left-right) and 20° vertically (up-down) when
                      different facial expression are present at the same time.
                      This was measured on a database of 12 persons using a single
                      training image for each person and in total 1824 test images
                      (surveillance scenario). This states a significant
                      performance increase in comparison to the recognition
                      without face normalization $(42,2\%).$ Are solely facial
                      expression changes present in the test images and neutral
                      views are used for training, the recognition rate is
                      $98,4\%$ (passport scenario, 21 persons and three training
                      images per person). The presented normalization approach
                      using a single, generic 3D head model is an efficient and
                      robust method for pose and facial expression invariant face
                      recognition which in comparison to existing approaches does
                      not require any manual intervention. Especially the
                      automatic and combined processing of facial expressions and
                      head poses in the considered range without usage or
                      generation of vast image databases is innovative and
                      provided by the presented approach for the first time.},
